# Express.js - Empty JSON Request Body Handling

This repository demonstrates a common issue in Express.js applications where empty JSON request bodies are not handled correctly. The server silently accepts the empty body, potentially leading to unexpected behavior and hard-to-debug issues in the application.

The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code.  The solution (`bugSolution.js`) addresses this by explicitly checking for the empty body and responding appropriately.
